To check if a move is legal or not, the board should preform these steps in order:

0. The piece moving must be of the same colour as the current player's turn

1. The move should follow the basic movement pattern of the piece (assuming an empty board)

2. The destination square must be empty or occupied by a piece of different colour

3. If the move is a sliding move (Queen, Bishop, Rook, or Pawn two-step) all the squares between the start and destination should be vacant

4. If the piece is pinned it can only move along the line between its king and the piece producing the attack

5. If the king is in check the only possible places a piece (other than the king) can move to is either a capture of the piece producing the check or to a square that blocks the attack

6. The king can only move to squares that are not attacked by the enemy's pieces

Special moves:
i.    If the move is an en passant, it needs to be checked whether the king can be attacked after the fact
ii.   The king cannot castle through attacked squares
